01  WS-AREA-1 PIC X(100). 
01  WS-AREA-2 PIC 9(5) VALUE 0. 
* In this code, if the program attempts to access WS-AREA-1 before it is initialized or after it has been deallocated, it may cause unexpected behavior or crashes. 
* Similar issues can occur if WS-AREA-2 is used for arithmetic operations without ensuring it's initialized with a valid value.
