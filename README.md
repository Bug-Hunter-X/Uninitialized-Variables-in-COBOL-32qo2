This repository demonstrates a common error in COBOL programs: using uninitialized variables.  Uninitialized variables can lead to unpredictable results and program crashes.  The `bug.cob` file contains the problematic code. The `bugSolution.cob` file shows how to properly initialize variables to prevent this error.  Always initialize your variables before using them in COBOL to ensure reliable program execution.
